<h1>Static content example</h1>

<p>This is an example of a static page. To create your own static page you
  simply need to create it in the <code>app/views/pages</code> folder. You are
  free to place pages in subfolders (like this one has been) to help organise
  your work. That's it!</p>

<p>The kit will take care of the rest and will know that anyone visiting
  <em>/pages/example1</em> should be shown this page.</p>
