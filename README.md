# Prototyping


Rails 4.2 example application that provides GDS Admin layout, with basic
admin functionality to enable fast prototyping of backend views
 
Includes :
 
The GovUK admin template :  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_admin_template

* "Devise" : https://github.com/plataformatec/devise (user management)
* "Bootstrap" : http://getbootstrap.com/


Use this application to prototype static views (pages)
 
Drop .html.erb pages into app/views/pages

## Installation

Fork or clone the project locally

cd into the project and install dependencies as usual :
 
```ruby
bundle install
```

Now run standard rails commands to get the DB setup and you're good to go.

```ruby
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

## Basic Configuration

###  Seed data

Run ```rake db:seed``` to populate Db with some sample Users.

To change or add to the sample set, edit 
```
db/seeds.rb
```

To truncate and reseed the DB
 
```
rake db:reset
``` 

## Layout

As well as static pages, you can use content_for hooks to inject content into 
in the GDS template. See the README for details of available content blocks
here : https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_admin_template
 
 e.g
 
```ruby
<% content_for ::navbar_right do %>
    <div>Some text for over there</div>
<% end %>

<% content_for :navbar_items do %>
  <li>
    <a href="#">navbar_item</a>
  </li>
<% end %>
```
