# Admin prototyping kit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EnvironmentAgency/admin-prototype-kit.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/EnvironmentAgency/admin-prototype-kit)

Based on a stripped down Rails 4.2 application, this kit provides a way to create high-res prototypes based on the [GOV.UK admin template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_admin_template) that users can interact with, as quickly and simply as possible.

## Use in production

In a word, **don't**. This kit has been designed for prototyping, not production code. Take only the lessons learned and your designs into a production system.

## Installation

Fork or clone the project locally

`cd` into the project and install dependencies as usual.

```bash
bundle install
```

## Start the service

To start the service locally simply run;

```bash
./startup.sh
```

You can then access it at http://localhost:3001

## Layout

As well as static pages, you can use content_for hooks to inject content into in the GDS template.

For example:

```HTML+ERB
<% content_for :navbar_right do %>
   <div>Some text for over there</div>
<% end %>

<% content_for :navbar_items do %>
 <li>
   <a href="#">navbar_item</a>
 </li>
<% end %>
```

See the [GOV.UK admin template README](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_admin_template) for details of available content blocks.
